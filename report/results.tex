\subsection{Initial Results}
The main problem with using single-line reactions with LDA is data sparsity: if each line is treated as a document, then LDA will see hundreds of thousands of 30-something-word documents where no words are ever repeated. Since LDA fundamentally relies on there being some repeated information (read: words) in order to make and inference on the data, it is necessary to aggregate lines from the CSV together to make some internal aggregate that corresponds to the concept of a 'document' in LDA-speak.\\

Our initial approach was to treat all reactions logged by a unique user to be clustered together; this would correspond to a document representing a single, unique user and topics generated by LDA to represent broad demographic clusters of all the users.

However, there is a lot of 'loud' information present that, when aggregated over a user tends to drown out potentially more interesting features.

For example: User $A$ reports that they are watching the debates on the internet. This means that every entry that $A$ logs will have an identical entry of \emph{How: internet}. Because of how we chose to aggregate multiple rows together, this lends an extremely high weight to a relatively unimportant feature. To see whether this had any major effect on returned topics, we ran LDA on the unmodified data, and again with unimportant features removed:

%insert pic here?

%insert pic2 here?

Features that were removed were:
\begin{list}
\item How:
\item PoliAware:
\item 
\end{list}



When we cluster documents around unique users, we get topics that look like very general demographics:\\
