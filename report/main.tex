\begin{abstract}
In this report, we investigated the representational power of recurrent neural networks for role disambiguation in Bang! a card-based party game where players are secretly assigned teams, and a player's role is hidden from other players. This class of games is considered hard, and other games of a similar format have been shown to have a true random pattern of action be the best strategy.

By representing players and their alignment without an implicit ordering in training, we created a theoretically fully scalable network to play games of a range of sizes. 

Further research into order-independent approaches using RNN's is recommended for other games where there is an implicit ordering associated with the output.
